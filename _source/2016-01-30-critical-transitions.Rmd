What is a stable system? A stable system is one that, if you push it out of balance, it will find it's balance again. Maybe it will take a while, maybe it will oscillate around the balance point, but finally it will be back in it's stable spot. A stable system must not be a static one. If it is under constant disturbance it will constantly be out of balance - but it will allways strive back to the balance point.

While a stable system is like a sack hanging on a rope or a ball in a bowl, an unstable system is like a pencil standing on it's tip. It is nearly impossible to stay in balance that way. Even the slightest disturbance will tip it over. If it is slightly out of it's balance spot it will accellerate more and more away from it. 

If we bring our imagination away from objects standing or our table (or not) there are systems that transition between a relatively stable state to a very unstable state. And we can observer this transition in how they react to disturbances.

# Working with paleoclimatic data

We will us data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
NOAA's former three data centers---the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), and the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC), which includes the National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC)—have merged into the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).
You will reach all of them over their central domain [ncei.noaa.gov](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov), but they retain their old domains at first. Therefore you will for example still find all climate informations at NCDC's website [ncdc.noaa.gov](http://ncdc.noaa.gov). Paleoclimatic datasets (aka past climate data retained from boreholes) you find under the url [http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data/datasets](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data/datasets).


Following two publications ([Livina & Lenton (2010)](http://www.clim-past.net/6/77/2010/cp-6-77-2010.html) and [Lenton et al (2012)](http://www.clim-past.net/8/1127/2012/cp-8-1127-2012.html)) cited at the [homepage of the early warnings signals toolbox ](http://www.early-warning-signals.org/case-studies/paleoclimatic-transitions/) we will use two data sets availbable from NCDC:

The [first dataset](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/study/2496), 
produced by Rasmussen et. al (2007)[^Rasmussen], is the one used in the above mentioned papers. It contains oxygen and calcium Isotope measurements from an ice core taken in Greenland dating way back to more than 30,000 years before present.

[^Rasmussen]:S.O. Rasmussen, I.K. Seierstad, K.K. Andersen, M. Bigler, D. Dahl-Jensen, and S.J. Johnsen. 2007. Synchronization of the NGRIP, GRIP, and GISP2 ice cores across MIS 2 and palaeoclimatic implications. Accepted, Quat. Sci. Rev., INTIMATE special issue, 2007

The [second dataset](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/study/2494), produced by 
Vinther at al (2006)[^Vinther], showing how the oxygen isotope data developed in the Holocene until today.

[^Vinther]:B.M. Vinther, H.B. Clausen, S.J. Johnsen, S.O. Rasmussen, K.K. Andersen, S.L. Buchardt, D. Dahl-Jensen, I.K. Seierstad, M.-L. Siggaard-Andersen, J.P. Steffensen, A.M. Svensson, J. Olsen, and J. Heinemeier. 2006. A synchronized dating of three Greenland ice cores throughout the Holocene. Journ. Geophys. Res., vol. 111, D13102.

## Download the Rasmussen

The Rasmussen dataset can be downloaded from this url:

```{r download-Rasmussen}
RasmussenURL <- "http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/icecore/greenland/summit/ngrip/gicc05-calcium-20yr.txt"
download.file(RasmussenURL, basename(RasmussenURL))
```

In the head of the file we read:
```{txt}

DESCRIPTION: 
Calcium concentration and d18O isotope ratios from the Greenland NGRIP, 
GRIP, and GISP2 ice cores on the GICC05 time scale. The period covered 
is 11.6-32.44 ka b2k (years before A.D. 2000).

Calcium concentration and d18O isotope ratios from the Greenland NGRIP, 
GRIP, and GISP2 ice cores resampled to 20 year resolution and presented 
on the GICC05 time scale. The period covered is 11.6-32.44 ka b2k 
(years before A.D. 2000).
The match points used for the transfer of the time scale to GRIP and GISP2 
depths can be found in the file Matchpoints_NGRIP_GRIP_GISP2_27nov2006.
The main file containing the GICC05 time scale and d18O values for NGRIP 
is named GICC05_NGRIP_GRIP_20y_27nov2006.
Holocene data for NGRIP1, NGRIP2, GRIP, and DYE-3 can be found in a 
separate file, named GICC05_Holocene_20y_27nov2006.
All files can be obtained from www.icecores.dk or from 
IGBP PAGES/World Data Center for Paleoclimatology.

The concept of maximum counting error (2nd column) is introduced in 
Rasmussen et al. (2006). In a standard deviation context, the maximum 
counting error should be regarded as 2 sigma as discussed in 
Andersen et al. (2006). The maximum counting error is a measure of the 
uncertainty of the GICC05 time scale.  It does not include uncertainty 
related to the transfer of the time scale to GRIP and GISP2 depths. 
The latter contribution is discussed in section 4 of the main reference: 
Rasmussen et al. (2008).

Age and depth values refer to the bottom of each interval.
Thus the NGRIP depth interval 1492.94 - 1493.62 m corresponds 
to the time interval 11720 - 11740 b2k, in
which the NGRIP d18O value is -39.72 permille.

The NGRIP1 core reaches down to a depth of 1372 m. The NGRIP2 core 
(drilled 20 meters away from the NGRIP1 core) reaches from surface 
to bedrock, but high-resolution measurements have only been carried 
out downwards from 1346 m. All depth reported here are NGRIP2 depths. 

The data supplied below are resampled to 20 year resolution from the 
original sources. Problems with missing data are ignored if the missing 
data comprise 25% or less of the depth interval of a given 20-year interval. 
If more than 25% of the data are missing, no value is given (indcated by "NaN").
NOTE: This is the issue corrected in the present file. In the original release, 
resampled values were also given if more than 25% of the data in a specific 
depth interval were missing.

download.file(VintherURL, basename(VintherURL))

```

In the head of the data file we read:

```{txt}
DESCRIPTION: 
Greenland Ice Core Chronology 2005 (GICC05) Holocene section.
Entire Holocene in 20-year resolution and d18O from NGRIP1, NGRIP2, GRIP, and DYE-3.
All ages are given in years b2k (years relative to A.D. 2000).
The concept of maximum counting error is introduced in Rasmussen et al. 
(Journ. Geophys. Res, 2006)

Age and depth values refer to the bottom of each interval.
Thus the NGRIP1 depth interval 14.15-20.4 m corresponds to the time interval 
40 - 60 b2k, in which the NGRIP1 d18O value is -35.11 permille.

The NGRIP1 core reaches down to a depth of 1372 m. 
The NGRIP2 core (drilled 20 meters away from the NGRIP1 core) reaches from surface to 
bedrock, but high-resolution measurements have only been carried out downwards from 1346 m. 
In the 26 m overlap zone, the cores are offset by 0.43 m on average, probably due to 
uncertainties in the logging procedure (see Sch�tt Hvidberg et al., Ann. Glac. 35, 2002). 
Thus, the same features appear at larger depths in the NGRIP1 than in the NGRIP2 core. 
When combining NGRIP1 and NGRIP2 data, we recommend to switch from NGRIP1 to NGRIP2 
in the year 9830b2k.

Down to 8313 b2k, DYE-3 is dated year by year. Below 8313 b2k the GRIP-NGRIP based 
time scale has been transferred to DYE-3 depths using the ECM profiles. This matching 
introduces a few years of uncertainty which is not included in the maximum counting error 
(column no. 10).

(*) Note that millennial-scale variations in the DYE-3 d18O data are significantly 
influenced by upstream effects. Furthermore, due to a problem with standards in the 
early 1980s, the DYE-3 d18O measurements are slightly off-set (maximum 0.5 permil) 
towards more negative values during the early Holocene.

## Download the Grootes data set

We can download the data set by Grootes from this url:

```{r download}
GrootesURL <- "http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/icecore/greenland/summit/gisp2/isotopes/gispd18o.txt"
download.file(GrootesURL, basename(GrootesURL))
```

In the head of the data file we read:

```{txt}
DATA DESCRIPTION: 

This file contains the GISP2 bidecadal delta 18O data set back to 16,510
yr B.P., measured at the Quaternary Isotope Laboratory, University of
Washington, as of February 1st, 1997.  The timescale includes revisions by
D. A. Meese as of September 1994. The GISP2 depths below 167 meters are
those of the D core; above 167 meters the core depths are those of the B
core + 1.09 meters.  See the file gisp2age.dat for further information on
the timescale. 

Between 1650.29 and 1844.88 meters, the delta 18-O values of this time
series are based on high resolution data (0.2 meter). They differ slightly
from the 2-meter time series (file UW2md18O.dat). 

The data columns represent: 

(1) top depths of intervals (in meters)

(2) mean delta 18-O values (in per mil) over bidecadal intervals starting
at top depths.  Standard deviation in a single delta 18-O measurement is
0.14 per mil. Multiple measurements (such as for the ones below) reduce
the standard deviation to the 0.05 to 0.1 per mil range. 

(3) layer count ages at top depths (in yr BP) where 0 BP represents AD
1950 SUMMER to AD 1949 SUMMER

DATA:		

Depth	d18O	Age (top)
Top (m)	(per mil)	(yr BP)

6.04	-34.7	-30
14.93	-34.78	-10
23.29	-34.83	10
30.45	-35.16	30
```

Therefore we read it like this:

```{r read-Grootes}
colnames <- c("Depth",	"d18O", "Age")
Grootes <- read.table(basename(GrootesURL), header = F, skip= 51, col.names = colnames, na.strings = "999999")
```


## Search for early warning signals in the paleo data

First we create a zoo timeseries from the Rasmussen and the Vinther GRIP $$\delta^{18}$$O variable. They overlap by 5 values so we cut off some from the Rasmussen data set.

```{r, zoo-timeseries}
paleoz <- zoo(c(Vinther$GRIP.d18O, Rasmussen$GRIP.d18O[-(1:5)]), order.by = c(Vinther$Age, Rasmussen$Age[-(1:5)]))
```

Then we will fill in the gaps that this timeseries has  by interpolating with the `na.approx()` function of the `zoo` package.

```{r fill-gaps}
paleoz <- na.approx(paleoz)
```

The next task is to smooth out the high frequency oscillations and produce a trendline for the series. We choose a bandwith of 558 like they did in the [Lenton et al (2012)](http://www.clim-past.net/8/1127/2012/cp-8-1127-2012.html) paper:

```{r smooth}
sm <- ksmooth(c(Vinther$Age, Rasmussen$Age[-(1:5)]), paleoz, "normal", bandwidth=558)
```

All this together plots like this:

```{r plot-all}
par(mar=c(4,4,.1,2), pch=20, mgp=c(2,1,0))
#xlim=c(22000, 12000)
xlim=c(32440, 0)
#plot(Vinther$Age, Vinther$GRIP.d18O, type="l", xlim=xlim, ylim=c(-45, -32), col="lightblue", xlab="Age")
plot(paleoz, xlim=xlim)
abline(v=c(12700, 14700, 11700))
lines(sm, col="red")
```

We then calculate the residuals representing the detrended short-term oscillations:

```{r Rasmussen-residuals}
residuals <- paleoz - sm$y
plot(residuals, type="h", xlim=xlim)
```


```{r, rolling-window}
window <-250
mvSD <- rollapply(residuals, width = window, FUN = var, na.rm=T, fill=NA, partial=F, align="left")
mvACF <- rollapply(residuals, width = window, FUN = acor, fill=NA, partial=F, align="left")

plot(mvSD, type="l", xlim=xlim, col="red")
#par(new=T)
plot(mvACF, type="l", xlim=xlim, col="green")
```
